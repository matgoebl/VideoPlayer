VideoPlayer
===========

Simple Android App that loads a list of videos and plays them using a VideoView.


This is a fork of https://github.com/ralphpina/VideoPlayer that loads the list from YouTube.

This fork
- loads the list from a hardcoded url.
- does not display likes and view count
- always reloads the list at startup
- has an icon from https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/educational-video_4258 (as this app plays educational videos for my kids)
